<p><strong>Sketch Drawing Dataset</strong>, We present a new dataset of paired images and contour drawings for the study of visual understanding and sketch generation. In this dataset there are 1000 outdoor images and each is paired with 5 human drawings 5000 drawings. Today I want to examine Photo Sketching in Python with GAN that helps to create such new images.</p>

<p>The Sketch dataset contains over 20000 sketches evenly distributed over 250 object categories. One solution might be creating the dataset just like hand drawn shapes with GAN. We present a new dataset of paired images and contour drawings for the study of visual understanding and sketch generation. The Quick Draw Dataset is a collection of 50 million drawings across 345 categories contributed by players of the game Quick Draw. The drawings were captured as timestamped vectors tagged with metadata including what the player was asked to draw.</p>
