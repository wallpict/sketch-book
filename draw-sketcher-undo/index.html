<p>Undo the line placement Ctrl Z. Undo bug in Sketcher. Undoing a very simple sketch with self constraints shortens the vertical axis so that it has to be enlarged to be visible again. If you select a detailed facade to copy it with the Move tool but accidentally stretch it instead you havent lost your detailed selection because Undo can rectify the problem instantly. If you draw a line and then Undo it the line will disappear. Draw a line that is coincident with the origin point and or is drawn so the horizontal or vertical constraint is automatically applied 4.
