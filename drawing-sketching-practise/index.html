<p>Scribble suggests using fruit as a practice for still life drawing allowing you to perfect your shapes strokes shadows and highlights while the object of your study sits still and accessible to you. It is the type of practice people recommend when they say you should take up a daily sketching habit. If you really want to practice try drawing. Practising this helps to understand the object better and its a great thing to have in your visual library because such odd perspectives can be used in the future to make a drawing.
